# Rolf's SALT repository

This is my SALT configuration repository. It is at this moment very minimal. It is actually used in my systems, and therefore I think it is a nice example.

To use this software, please take a look at [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/)! It is an awesome piece of software.

## License

This project uses The [unilicense](LICENSE). This essentially means you are free to do anything with it. It is, however, highly appreciated if you make your salt states publicly available. This helps people new to salt learn it! (Let me know if you do!)
