# Rolf's SALT repository

This is my SALT configuration repository. It is at this moment very minimal. It is actually used in my systems, and therefore I think it is a nice example.

To use this software, please take a look at [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/)! It is an awesome piece of software.
